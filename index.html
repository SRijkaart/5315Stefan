      <h2>What is Docker?</h2>
      <p>Docker is a tool that allows developers to package up their applications with all necessary components into a so-called "container", which is built to work on a variety of operating systems and versions. From my understanding, there are a number of benefits to utilizing this "container" method. One benefit of this method is that containers are a more lightweight system virtualization, allowing for more processes to be run on given hardware than could be with virtual machines. According to Amazon's AWS website, containers are also helpful for ensuring environmental consistency and version control for applications. They liken containers to building blocks in an environment. This means that applications can be incorporated into your system and should work regardless of the operation system you use, and I believe it means the user can tweak the applications to their specific needs without having to re-work the application from the ground up.</p>

      <h2>What is Nginx?</h2>
      <p>Nginx is a popular open-source web server software. As a web server, it is used to serve content to the World Wide Web via the HTTP protocol, allowing for many different simultaneous connections to an IP address. It is often used by web servers as a so-called "load balancer", allowing workloads to be distributed across multiple computing resources. The end result of this "load balancing" is faster response times and avoiding overloading any one specific resource. Compared to the Apache web server, Nginx uses less memory, allowing it to handle (according to Wikipedia) roughly four times more requests per second, supposedly at the cost of decreased flexibility when compared to Apache.</p>

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)?</h2>
      <p>A virtual machine is a computer file that behaves like an actual different computer. We use this type of software at Seattle University when we are logging in to our student accounts on school computers. There are a number of benefits to using virtual machines. For one, users can run multiple virtual machines simultaneously from one computer. Each of these virtual machines is completely seperate from the operations of the primary computer and each other, meaning that software run in the virtual machines cannot affect the primary computer or any other instances of virtual machines. This also means that multiple different operating systems could be utilized on one computer via the use of virtual machines. Further, multiple virtual machines can be used to share memory loads, easing the hardware requirements to execute certain processes.</p>

      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digitalocean?</h2>
      <p>Digitalocean is a cloud platform company, providing web servers to customers. This allows developers to deploy and scale applications based on their size requirements, without needing to purchase physical server hardware themselves. The company refers to its web servers as Droplets, and boasts a flat pricing structure as one of the main benefits to customers over other services.</p>
